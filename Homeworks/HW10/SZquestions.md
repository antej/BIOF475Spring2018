So I finally think I have settled on a final project that isn't either of the things I have previously proposed. My new project is to try and get as far as I can on this Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening as possible. I've started data cleaning and looking at the variables, and there's a lot of potential text analysis to do. One small place I'm stuck is trying to find a package or function in R that can classify words by tense. I was able to use tidytext to do some sentiment analysis which is interesting but I would like to get more out of the text than sentiment. My plan is to make variables for sentiment, amount of nouns, verbs, adjectives, essay length, things like that and then use that in a model to try and predict if the applications were accepted.
