My biggest pain point is that I think I have to make a change from the original idea that I submitted back in week 2.
At that time, I thought that I would be able to get data off of webpages, so the sources that I described (ex. Amazon shopping pages, 
Library of Congress) are probably not sources that I can use. So I have to come up with other sources. I may actually change my project idea
to something else; maybe something using environmental data.
