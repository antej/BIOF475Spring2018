Two sets of data are used in this project:

1. Air quality data:

I obtained the air quality data by downloading the historical data from Airnow API using query format:

http://www.airnowapi.org/aq/observation/zipCode/historical/?format=text/csv&zipCode=<zipcode>&date=YYYY-MM-DDT00-0000&distance=25&API_KEY=<key>

The API has 500 queries/hour limit. The data is 24-hour average PM25 and Ozone. This part is done by running an hourly cron job to call a python script which retrieves the data.

The data is fed to Rstudio, the date field was splitted for calculation of mean, max, min, median and std for each year:

airnow <- read_csv("airnow-data/airnow-20906.csv", col_types = cols(DateObserved = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d")))
colnames(airnow_20906) <- c("DateObserved","HourObserved","LocalTimeZone","ReportingArea","StateCode","Latitude","Longitude","ParameterName","AQI","CategoryNumber","CategoryName")

library(dplyr);
library(tidyr);
df <- airnow_20906 %>% separate(DateObserved, into=c("Year","Month", "Day"),sep="-")
df2 <- df %>%
group_by(Year,ParameterName) %>%
summarise(YMean=mean(AQI, na.rm=TRUE), YMax=max(AQI,  na.rm=TRUE), YMin=min(AQI,  na.rm=TRUE), YMedian=median(AQI,  na.rm=TRUE), YStd=sd(AQI,  na.rm=TRUE))
df2

2. Bluebird nesting data:

The data came in .xlsx format with nested cells. Rows with missing data are removed, then it was converted to csv format. Non-ascii characters are removed using sed command:

    sed -i 's/[^[:print:]]//' bluebird-clean.csv

The table is melted and formated using an awk script:

#!/usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN {
    FS = ","
    format = "%s,%s,%s,%s\n"
    printf format, "Trail", "Boxes", "Fledged", "Year"
}
{
        printf format, $1, $2, $3,"2010";
        printf format, $1, $4, $5,"2011";
        printf format, $1, $6, $7,"2012";
        printf format, $1, $8, $9,"2013";
        printf format, $1, $10, $11,"2014";
}
