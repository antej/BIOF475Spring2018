So far I have developed a GUI using Shiny that allows:
  - Visualizing one (FPKM per group) or more (heatmap) genes of interest of an RNAseq experiment.
  - Performing the PCA analysis of the different groups.
  - Exporting the raw data to .csv files.
  
The next steps would be adding different datasets directly from the GUI and performing further analysis in the platform.
