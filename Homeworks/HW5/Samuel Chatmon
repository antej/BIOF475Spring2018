Question 

What Machine Learning Model besides random forest could be built? 

Answer

From what I learned in class, I am thinking that the model must be a supervised learning one. 
Therefore, I could deploy a model that utilized a neural network algorithm.  For example, such 
a model may predict the probability of a teenager becoming a pro basketball player based on height 
and distance of home from a city park.
