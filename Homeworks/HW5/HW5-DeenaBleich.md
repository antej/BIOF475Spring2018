### Some form of **Regression Analysis** could be used in lieu of the Random Forest model. Regression analysis can be used for prediction and forecasting (though it is also used to explore causal relationships).  A dependent variable is determined based on one or more independent variables, by fitting algorithms.

### The most straightforward regression model is linear regression, in which there are only two variables, X and Y, which can be visualized on a graph. This leads to numerous points on the graph, through which a best fitting line can be drawn.  This would be analogous to the training data set.  Then test data could be compared against it to see if it fits near this line.

### In the heart example shown in class, a more complex form of regression analysis than the example above should be used since there are multiple independent variables.
