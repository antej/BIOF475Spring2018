There are many ways to train a model to output a binary classification (i.e. Heart Failure Risk or Not), Random Forest being
just one of them. 
One simple method is a Naive Bayesian classifier, which will assume all information input for a subject is independent 
and attempt to classify an individual based on the probability of Heart Failure given each characteristic.
While an assumption of information independence may not be valid in this case (e.g. BMI, Cholesterol and Exercise Per Week
are likely highly correlated), this would be one method that could be used.
