Classification: 
The outcome value is in a set of pre-defined data. The example will be for a chess engine to predict its next move.
Algorithms for classification

    Decision Trees
    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes
    K Nearest Neighbors
    Linear SVC (Support vector Classifier)
    etc
    
Regression: 
The outcome value is continuous. The example will be for the retailers to decide how many pieces of certain items to order.
Regression Algorithms

    Linear Regression
    Regression Trees(e.g. Random Forest)
    Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    etc
