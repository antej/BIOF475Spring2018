Classification is used to assign data points to groups or labels based on some attribute(s). 
Regression is used to predict values of dependent variables given independent variable values. 
Some classification algorithms are k-means, nearest neighbors, na√Øve Bayes, and decision trees/random forests. 
Some regression methods are ANOVAs (and ANCOVA, MANCOVA etc.), you can also add non-linear relationship tests and interactions.
