Question: Homework for Week 7 is to tell me what is the difference between Classification and Regresssion, and what algorithms are best to use with both.

Regression: Attempts to assign an input to a continuous value. Performance is evaluated via accuracy of grouping.
Classification: Attempts to assign an input to discrete groups. Performance is evaluated via accuracy deviation between the assigned labels and predicted labels.

Algorithms:
  - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, LASSO Regression, ElasticNet Regression
  - Classification: K-Means Clustering, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayesian Classifier, Decision Trees
