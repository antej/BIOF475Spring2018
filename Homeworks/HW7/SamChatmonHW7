While both Classification and Regression are two kinds of supervised machine learning algorithms, the former is based on discrete or 
categorical variables while the latter is based on continuous ones.  The Classification predictive model can be used to place something 
in one of two groups (binomial classification) or even more groups (multi-class classification).  For example, to predict the gender of 
an individual based on how much weight he or she can bench press. However, the output of a Regression problem is a real value.  A simple
demonstration of this type of machine learning would be determining the size of a DNA fragment that has migrated in an agarose gel based
on the sizes of the bands of a DNA ladder.
