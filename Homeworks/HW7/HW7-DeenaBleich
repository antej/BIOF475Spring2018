Classification - Puts input data into predefined discrete classes, based on the best match for the input data.
Regression - Maps input data based on a statistical model that uses the continuous distribution trend of the training data set.

Some Classification Algorithms:
Decision tree
Neural network

some Regression Algorithms:
Linear regression
Logistic regression
