## Analysis of RNAseq data from muscle biopsies

Bioinformatic analysis of ~150 muscle biopsy RNAseq from patients with different types of inflammatory myopathy and healthy controls:

The main objectives of the project will be:
  - Assess the utility of RNAseq to differentiate normal from diseased muscle biopsies.
  - Compare autoantibody grouping to clinical classification in terms of biopsy RNAseq homogeneity.
  - Identify specific pathways involved in the different types of inflammatory myopahty.
  - Assess the diagnostic utility of the muscle biopsy RNAseq to classify the different types of inflammatory myopathy.
  - Study the correlation between muscle disease activity measurements (CK, strength...) with the RNAseq paramenters.
  - Study the association between classical biopsy features (perifascicular atrophy, necrosis...) with the RNAseq.
  - Study the association between extramuscular myositis features (lung and skin involvement) with the muscle RNAseq.
  - Study the expression of the antigens of the different myositis autoantibodies (CHD4 in anti-Mi2, HMGCR in anti-HMGCR...) in positive vs. negative patients.
