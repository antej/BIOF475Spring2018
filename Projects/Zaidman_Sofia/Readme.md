For my final project, I would like to learn how to make a compositional pattern-producing neural network to generate my own novel images - similar to the google deep dream project (https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html). I’m still not entirely clear on what the specific steps are to accomplish this. From the research I’ve done so far, I think I could either make my own neural network and find a database with a bunch of training images, or I could somehow find a neural network that already exists and has been trained already. A good resource is this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1897v4.pdf, which details a similar process. I still need to do a lot more research on how to tweak a neural network once it exists to have it generate new images rather than recognize existing images. The main point of this project is for me to learn more about neural networks and to make my own.
