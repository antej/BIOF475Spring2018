I am interested in examining the question: What topics are people most interested in reading about?

People purchase (and review) many books from Amazon.  Also, people review and recommend books on Goodreads. Both of these sites have a lot of data about the books; for instance, Amazon has best seller rankings. 

Almost every published book is in the Library of Congress catalog, which is publicly searchable at https://catalog.loc.gov/.  Library information about each book is stored in a special format called MARC. 

The MARC record has many identifying attributes, including Library of Congress Subject fields.

For instance, here’s the MARC record for Jeffrey Stanton’s 2017 book:
(There is also an XML formatted version).

So, what I am thinking of doing is figuring out a way to get information about the popularity of a book (by sales and/or rating) from sites such as Amazon or Goodreads and map the book to the Library of Congress record about it and compile the LC subjects to see what subjects people are most interested in.
