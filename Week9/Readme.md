## Classification VS Regression

### Classification: Discrete valued Y (e.g. 1,2,3 and 4)

### Regression: Continues Values Y (e.g. 222.6, 300, 568,â€¦)

# Why Pareto?
### The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
