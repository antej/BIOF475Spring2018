# Homework 
## Regression Algorithms

    * Linear Regression
    * Regression Trees(e.g. Random Forest)
    * Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    * etc
    
## Algorithms for classification

    * Decision Trees
    * Logistic Regression
    * Naive Bayes
    * K Nearest Neighbors
    * Linear SVC (Support vector Classifier)
    * etc
    
## Classification VS Regression

### Classification: Discrete valued Y (e.g. 1,2,3 and 4)

### Regression: Continues Values Y (e.g. 222.6, 300, 568,â€¦)
# Recap:

## Language comparison: Java = native, R = statistical (RAM), Python = general, Julia = scientific, Scala = realtime (RDD), Clojure = functional (also: Pig Latin and HiveQL)

# Why Pareto?
### The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
